## Lesson 4 - Signatures and zero knowledge proofs & Randomness and shared secrets.

**Expected Duration:** 2 weeks


**Plan:**
* Read Chapters 7-8 of [RWC](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography?a_aid=Realworldcrypto&a_bid=ad500e09)
  * Understand core concepts (ðŸŽ‰ send pull requests with definitions/documentation updates ðŸŽ‰)
  * Read up on group theory and the related mathematical concepts 
* Complete 
  * Challenge Exercises 
* Meet-up: 1x Q&A, explainers & challenge response reviews @ Tuesday, September 13th, 5:30 pm CET (Central European Time)

**Challenge Exercises**

a. Explain your answers in English, such that anyone reading the answer for the first time can follow-along, preferably in a markdown file.

b. Prepare 1 or more implementations in 1 or more languages of your choice; for example: Python, Rust, Javascript. (if needed)

---

1. Define a digital signature. What are some real world examples of where they would be implemented

2. What is the difference between MACs and digital signatures?

3. As you saw in chapter 3, authnetication tags produced by MACs must be verified in constant time to avoid timing attacks. Do you think we need to do the same for verifiying signatures?

4. Provide a demonstration in a programming language of your choice for a digital signature.

5. How do digital signatures create secure communication for authenticated key exchanges, or public key infrastructures for sites?

6. Why are zero knowledge proofs so difficult to construct mathematically? Explain the goal.

7. What did the fiat-Shamir transformation eventually lead up to?
   
8. Why is using/implementing RSA signatures generally a bad idea?

9.  Provide a couple real world examples of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) in practice. 

10. What is the difference between a determinsitic and predictable process?

12. What could a PRNG be useful?
   
13. What is one of the most common sources of entropy?

14. Explain the difference between private and public randomness.

15. Why would a KDF be useful? Provide an example of a primitive and how it would be implemented.
