## Lesson 2 - MAC & Advanced encryption

**Expected Duration:** 2 weeks


**Plan:**
* Read Chapters 3-4 of [RWC](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography?a_aid=Realworldcrypto&a_bid=ad500e09)
  * Understand core concepts (ðŸŽ‰ send pull requests with definitions/documentation updates ðŸŽ‰)
* Complete 
  * Challenge Exercises 
* Meet-up: 1x Q&A, explainers & challenge response reviews @ Tuesday, Aug 9, 5:30 pm CET (Central European Time)



### Todo ###
* Add sources here that were shared in exercise code / answers / pull requests
* Prepare links/glossary of definitions and resources for all core concepts

**Challenge Exercises**

a. Explain your answers in English, such that anyone reading the answer for the first time can follow-along, preferably in a markdown file.

b. Prepare 1 or more implementations in 1 or more languages of your choice; for example: Python, Rust, Javascript.

---

1. Provide an general abstract definition, and an example of a MAC in use. (Provide a simple definition for a message authentication code).

2. What is the relationship between MAC and a hash function?

3. Not all MACs are PRFs. Can you see why?

4. Provide a demonstration of a HMAC in a programming language of your choice.

5. Why can some 128 bit cryptographic algorithms have collision attacks while other algorithms are resistant?

6. What is advanced encryption used for, compared to something such as a hash function?

7. What is the fundamental problem demonstrated with AES-ECB? (Provide an example or demonstration.)

8. In AES-CBC, how can we prevent the ciphertext as well as the IV from being modified by an attacker?
