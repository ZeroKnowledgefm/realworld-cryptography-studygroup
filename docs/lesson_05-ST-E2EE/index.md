**Challenge Exercises**

a. Explain your answers in English, such that anyone reading the answer for the first time can follow-along, preferably in a markdown file.

b. Prepare 1 or more implementations in 1 or more languages of your choice; for example: Python, Rust, Javascript. (if needed)

2. Why do we need something such as TLS?

3. What is the difference between SSL and TLS?

4. Is version control a problem with these protocols? Why?

5. Are 'secure transport' protocols considered symmetric or asymmetric? Why?
